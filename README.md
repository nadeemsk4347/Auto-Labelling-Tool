# Auto-Labelling-Tool
Auto-Labelling-Tool is develpoed using Pyqt5. In the App/tool we can load a tensorflow model(frozen graph) and load a folder containing images. Model runs inference on images and draws bounding boxes.

# How to use this?
1. Setup [Tensorflow Object Detection API](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/object_detection) on your computer
2. Copy these three files into `models/research/object_detection/colab_tutorials/`
3. Run the `Object_Detector.py` file and you are good to go :)
